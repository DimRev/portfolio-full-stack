## About Me

I am a passionate **web developer** with one year of professional experience, currently working for Atlas Social Investment. At Atlas, we are developing an application that connects investees with investors based on their field of interest. The applications I have been building and maintaining for my work are fullstack web apps written in Angular, Express, Nest, and Next.js.

Alongside my professional work, I have been expanding my skills by diving into other programming languages. In particular, I've focused on Go, where I am developing a CLI package designed to create quick user forms with validation, inspired by TypeScript's Zod library. Additionally, I am working on an innovative game project that is similar to chess but designed to be played in two different CLI instances connected to a server.

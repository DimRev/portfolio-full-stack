Absolutely, here's a more stylized version without the code blocks:

## About Me

Hello! My name is **Dima**, and I'm a _junior web developer_ currently working at [Atlas Social Investments](https://atlas.org.il/en/about/) as a **fullstack engineer**. My role involves:

- Developing, implementing, and testing new features
- Maintaining legacy code
- Implementing UI features
- Deploying applications in serverless environments (like Vercel)
- Deploying applications in AWS EC2 instances, both with and without Docker containers

I've learned a great deal during my time here.

Apart from my professional work, I've developed a strong interest in **backend development**, leading me to delve into **Go**. To familiarize myself with Go's concepts, I've implemented various projects, from basic CRUD servers to more complex systems. Currently, I'm working on two _semi-major Go projects_:

### CLI Form Builder

This package aims to validate user input through built-in functions, making form creation and validation streamlined and efficient.

### CLI Chess-like Game

A game where **two players** compete against each other in the CLI, with a server orchestrating the communication between them.

I'm excited about these projects and look forward to continuing my journey in both web and backend development.

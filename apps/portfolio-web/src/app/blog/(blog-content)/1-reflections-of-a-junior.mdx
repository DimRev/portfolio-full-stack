## Reflections of a Junior WebDev

Hello! I wanted to share my thoughts about what it's like to be a junior web developer and reflect on my journey so far—the good, the bad, what I would have done differently, and my plans moving forward.

### Introduction

To begin, I started coding about a year ago. Before that, I was pursuing mechanical engineering in college. However, I made the decision to leave during the final semester of my last year, with just a few subjects remaining to complete the degree. This was around four years ago. The early dropout from college was a direct result of the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, which abruptly shifted everything to remote learning without adequate preparation or experience on my part. Adapting to remote education proved to be a significant challenge. Initially, my interest waned, followed by a loss of motivation, ultimately impacting my academic performance, leading to my decision to drop out.

During my time in college, I encountered programming through various courses, with C and Assembly being notable examples. While these courses did not delve deeply into advanced concepts, they provided foundational knowledge that sparked my interest in the field.

My journey up to this point is kidna unique, as is the case for many who transition into a programming career later in life. I am not recounting the typical path of a 20-year-old who attends boot camps or pursues a CS degree, sends out numerous resumes, lands interviews, and secures a job. (Note: I have no biases against boot camps; in fact, I later graduated from one. Nor do I discredit formal college degrees. If circumstances had been different, I might have completed one myself.)

### First Step into the World of Code

So, I dipped my toes into programming, wrote some code to control a few motors with Arduino, and thought, "Hey, this is pretty cool!" But then came the big question: What next? Returning to college wasn't on my radar—it just didn't make financial or time sense for me.

Digging deeper, I discovered that the programming languages I knew weren't opening many doors. Especially in fields like embedded systems, most roles seemed to demand a computer science degree. While breaking into embedded systems without that degree is possible today, it often requires a level of expertise beyond what I had then.

Game development sounded enticing at first—who wouldn't want to work on games? But as I looked into it, I realized the industry often operates on intense schedules, with crunch time being the norm. Indies thrive on passion, while larger companies can sometimes drain that passion. As much as I loved the idea of game development, I also needed stability.

Then there's web development, which seemed like a golden ticket according to all those YouTube videos. Learn the basics for a few months, and you're set for a job at FAANG, they said. However, I had my doubts. The reality was more nuanced than the pitch. Sure, COVID created a surge in demand for junior web developers, but as we moved past 2023 and the COVID situation stabilized, the market began to correct itself after the hiring spree, which wasn't great news for me.

After some thinking over the options I've had so far I gravitated towards WebDev it seemd like the most stable choise even with the redicoulous claims there is shred of truth to them.

### Webdev

After making a decision onto a path, now I've just went to check what is WebDev? Oh-boy... I wasn't ready for that... The only consistant thing that I've realized about WebDev is that there is no consistancy, no one agrees on nothing, is HTML a language? Whats the deal with PHP and lambos, What the fuck is ruby and why does it have rails? Is Javascript good, or is it the worst? Is Typescript a linter? What is a linter?
And I've only scratched the surface of this plie of maddness, I've formed an opinion that tech-twitter isn't a place for newbies trying to understand how to get into tech, it's a place for people to shout into the void about what they are hyped about for the next 15 minutes, got it - not for me.

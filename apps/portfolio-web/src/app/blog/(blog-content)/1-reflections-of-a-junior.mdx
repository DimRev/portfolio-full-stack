# Reflections of a Junior WebDev

## Introduction

Hello! I wanted to share my thoughts about what it's like to be a junior web developer and reflect on my journey so far—the good, the bad, what I would have done differently, and my plans moving forward.

To begin, I started coding about a year ago. Before that, I was pursuing mechanical engineering in college. However, I made the decision to leave during the final semester of my last year, with just a few subjects remaining to complete the degree. This was around four years ago. The early dropout from college was a direct result of the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, which abruptly shifted everything to remote learning without adequate preparation or experience on my part. Adapting to remote education proved to be a significant challenge. Initially, my interest waned, followed by a loss of motivation, ultimately impacting my academic performance, leading to my decision to drop out.

During my time in college, I encountered programming through various courses, with C and Assembly being notable examples. While these courses did not delve deeply into advanced concepts, they provided foundational knowledge that sparked my interest in the field.

My journey up to this point is kind of unique, as is the case for many who transition into a programming career later in life. I am not recounting the typical path of a 20-year-old who attends boot camps or pursues a CS degree, sends out numerous resumes, lands interviews, and secures a job. (Note: I have no biases against boot camps; in fact, I later graduated from one. Nor do I discredit formal college degrees. If circumstances had been different, I might have completed one myself.)

## First Steps into the World of Code

So, I dipped my toes into programming, wrote some code to control a few motors with Arduino, and thought, "Hey, this is pretty cool!" But then came the big question: What next? Returning to college wasn't on my radar—it just didn't make financial or time sense for me.

Digging deeper, I discovered that the programming languages I knew weren't opening many doors. Especially in fields like embedded systems, most roles seemed to demand a computer science degree. While breaking into embedded systems without that degree is possible today, it often requires a level of expertise beyond what I had then.

Game development sounded enticing at first—who wouldn't want to work on games? But as I looked into it, I realized the industry often operates on intense schedules, with crunch time being the norm. Indies thrive on passion, while larger companies can sometimes drain that passion. As much as I loved the idea of game development, I also needed stability.

Then there's web development, which seemed like a golden ticket according to all those YouTube videos. Learn the basics for a few months, and you're set for a job at FAANG, they said. However, I had my doubts. The reality was more nuanced than the pitch. Sure, COVID created a surge in demand for junior web developers, but as we moved past 2023 and the COVID situation stabilized, the market began to correct itself after the hiring spree, which wasn't great news for me.

After some thinking over the options I've had so far, I gravitated towards web development. It seemed like the most stable choice even with the ridiculous claims—there's a shred of truth to them.

## Tech Twitter

After deciding on a path, I went to check out what web development was all about. Oh boy, I wasn't ready for that. The only consistent thing I realized about web development is that there is no consistency. No one agrees on anything. Is HTML a language? What's the deal with PHP and Lambos? What is Ruby, and why does it have rails? Is JavaScript good or the worst? Is TypeScript a linter? What is a linter?

I quickly formed the opinion that tech Twitter isn't the place for newbies trying to understand how to get into tech. It's more of a place for people to shout into the void about whatever they're hyped about for the next 15 minutes. Got it—tech Twitter is not for me.

## YouTube

Despite the oversaturation of "how I would learn to code if I were to start over" videos, they seem to have become perennial content or some sort of initiation ritual. So, after watching a few of those, I pieced together a roadmap from the most agreed-upon points, which goes like this:

- Learn HTML & CSS
- Learn JavaScript
- Build projects
- Learn a framework

Not much of an overview, but that's pretty much the rough roadmap.

## Tutorial Hell

I started with an overview of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—why they work the way they do, why they break, why people hate them, and what the alternatives are. These were all interesting questions with complicated answers. It took me about two months to feel somewhat comfortable with the syntax and to have some understanding of what I was doing. I'm not saying I knew how JavaScript worked under the hood, but I was a beginner wizard—I knew how to make the magic happen, even if I didn't fully understand why it worked.

Shoutout to the channels that helped me a lot:

## Framework

Up till this point, I'd been working with vanilla JavaScript. I understood that frameworks were supposed to take JavaScript and make it better. How? No idea. Why? No idea. Honestly, I'd been doing fine so far with basic to-do apps, tic-tac-toe games, and even a blackjack game. If I could manage that as a one-month developer, why would I need anything else?

And again there are tons of options here again, React everyone uses it, Angular most hate it but whoever uses it swears by it, Vue the new hot thing, Svelte, Solid... I can continue this list but you get the point choice is great for an experienced developer that knows what he's doing but as a newbie I need someone to make the choices as seeing the overwhelming amount of documentation that their are on frameworks and how they are supposed to work with backend servers and a whole layer of things that I couldn't even begin to understand in my current point in a reasonable amount of time I've did what I thought reasonable and efficient for my time and signed up for a bootcamp.

## Bootcamp

Realizing that the world of frameworks is a deep pit where picking one might lock you in somewhat to what you're comfortable in working with instead of picking one I've signed up to a bootcamp that focuses on React (as it is the most common framework at the time) but gives you some additional lessons with Angular and Vue. In my opinion the bootcamp is a great way to level up quickly. I don't know about other bootcamps but at least the one that I've attended focuses on building projects. The first month basically gives you some basics in JS, CSS, and HTML which closed some of the holes in knowledge that I've had. I found that relearning a subject after you've progressed into another gives you a better perspective about how to use it but I digress. Aside from learning how to work with React the bootcamp emphasized around how to work without a framework working with jQuery and realizing the problems that a framework actually ties to solve, state, SPA, routing, then we've switched to constructing simple CRUD servers using express and all in all 5 month later I've crammed so much knowledge into my head that I don't doubt that I would've missed going by myself.

## Staying Up to Date

So, I finished the bootcamp, went through the interview stages, and landed a job. Sweet, right? Absolutely! But here’s the thing—I’m not satisfied. Sure, I'm proud of what I've achieved so far, but I know I can do much more. I’ve got dozens of project ideas swirling in my mind. Some are way over my current skill set, but that’s the fun part—challenging myself and learning in the process. For instance, I’ve been diving deep into SQL to understand indexing, query optimization, and designing efficient schemas. Simultaneously, I explored Next.js, appreciating its server-side rendering and static site generation features, and used it to build a complex e-commerce site. Venturing into serverless architecture, I learned to create serverless functions with AWS Lambda, building scalable and cost-effective solutions. Combining these skills, I developed a full-stack social media platform using Next.js for the frontend, a serverless backend with AWS, and PostgreSQL for relational data. This continuous learning and integration of various technologies keep me motivated and excited about my future in web development.

## Conclusion

The journey of a junior web developer is filled with learning, challenges, and continuous growth. From college dropout to bootcamp graduate, every step has been a part of the learning process. The key takeaway? Sit on your ass, code, make mistakes, search for the answer, delve deeper, and repeat until you get stuck in the same circle. That's how you grow.
